<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This file touches on one of the more advanced sides of Seemes; namely, customization of the <code>config.php</code> file.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Just for Starters</h3>
<p>For your reference throughout the rest of this guide, here is a sample <code>config.php</code> file.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything should be self-explanatory.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Changing the Menu Formatting</h3>
<p>To change the way menu items are formatted, you can alter the variable <code>$websitemenuformatting</code>. As you can see by looking at the example, it's basically just an escaped copy of the HTML string you want as a result, with a few strings in it that are automatically replaced with the item-specific information.</p>
<h5>Replacements</h5>
<ul>
<li><code>%menucurrentitem%</code> becomes the contents of <code>$websitemenucurrentitem</code> if that menu item is for the current page.</li>
<li><code>%menuhref%</code> becomes the URL of the link.</li>
<li><code>%menuid%</code> becomes the ID of the menu item. In the case of normal page links, this is the filename of the page without the extension.</li>
<li><code>%menuname%</code> becomes the name of the menu item.</li>
<li><code>%menunumber%</code> becomes the number of the menu item (with the count starting at 1).</li>
</ul>
