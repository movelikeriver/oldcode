<h2>Installation</h2>
<hr />
<p>Installation should be relatively quick and simple. To complete it with minimal difficulty, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload all the files in the archive to your webserver.</li>
<li><code>CHMOD</code> the following:
<ul>
<li>The folder that Seemes is in: <code>0777</code></li>
<li>The folder <code>data/</code>: <code>0777</code></li>
<li>The folder <code>files/</code>: <code>0777</code></li>
<li>The folder <code>img/</code>: <code>0777</code></li>
<li>The folder <code>themes/</code>: <code>0777</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open (the uploaded copy of) <code>install/install1.php</code> in your browser. Optionally, browsing to the folder you've uploaded Seemes to will give you a link to the installer.</li>
<li>Follow the steps.</li>
<li>Now browse to the root of the folder you've installed to. Your website should be up and running.</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> It is <em>highly recommended</em> that you delete the folder <code>install/</code> after the installation has completed. As far as we know, the scripts in it are secure, however, they have not been tested extensively, and should a vulnerability be found in them, an attacker could possibly reset your entire site configuration, including password!</li>
