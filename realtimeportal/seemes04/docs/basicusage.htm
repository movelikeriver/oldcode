<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>All the work is done from the <strong>Admin Control Panel</strong>, which can be accessed through the file <code>admin.php</code> in the folder in which you installed Seemes. To get started, go there and log in. (Your password is the one you gave when you installed.)</p>
<hr />
<h3>Overview of the Admin Control Panel</h3>
<p>The various tasks you can perform in the Admin Control Panel are listed in the menu on the left-hand side of the page. They shoud be pretty much self-explanatory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create page:</strong> Lets you create a new page.</li>
<li><strong>Delete page:</strong> Lets you delete an existing page.</li>
<li><strong>Edit page:</strong> Lets you edit an existing page.</li>
<li><strong>Move page:</strong> Lets you change the actual filename of an existing page (as opposed to just the title of the page, which can be changed in <strong>Edit Page</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Edit menu:</strong> Lets you edit the menu file, for such things as changing the order of menu items.</li>
<li><strong>Image manager:</strong> Lets you upload, rename, and delete files in the image directory (default <code>img/</code>).</li>
<li><strong>File manager:</strong> Lets you upload, rename, and delete files in the general upload directory (default <code>files/</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Edit theme:</strong> Lets you edit any plain text file in your theme directory.</li>
<li><strong>Change settings:</strong> Lets you change a few general settings: the website name, copyright line, theme, and password. <strong>Note:</strong> if you don't enter a new value for a setting (i.e. you leave the field blank), that setting will not be changed.</li>
<li><strong>Log out:</strong> Lets you log out of your Admin Control Panel. (Highly recommended on public and shared computers.)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>General information</h3>
<p>The best way to learn to administer Seemes is to play around with it (or wait until better documentation shows up). However, there are a few bits of general information that will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page filename:</strong> This is the actual page filename (e.g. <code>mypage</code>). This is what you'll get when you ask for a <strong>Page listing</strong>. This is what the system uses and should not be confused with...</li>
<li><strong>Page name:</strong> The "nice" name of the page (e.g. <code>My Page</code>). This is what the user sees.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Installing Themes</h3>
<p>This is a pretty simple process. Make sure all the theme files are in their correct place on the website. Now, go into your Admin Control Panel, and the <strong>Change settings</strong> section. Enter a new theme name (including the extension) and hit <strong>Change settings</strong>. Now sit back and enjoy your new theme!</p>
