<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Currently, there is no automated (or even easy) way to upgrade your existing Seemes website. The best procedure to follow is detailed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all files and folders from your existing Seemes-powered website except for the folders (and contents of) <code>data/</code>, <code>files/</code>, <code>img/</code>, and <code>themes/</code>.</li>
<li>Unzip the contents of the newest Seemes distribution archive to somewhere on your local computer.</li>
<li>Upload all of the files and folders except for those above that you didn't delete.</li>
<li>Re-run the installation procedure.</li>
</ol>
<p>All your old data will remain intact.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can't just not delete <code>config.php</code>, upload the new files, and hope for the best, because the variables in <code>config.php</code> usually change slightly from version to version.</p>
<p>Those who wish to minimize their downtime are advised to download their website to their computer, follow the upgrade procedure locally (using an easy to set up local package server such as <a href="http://apachefriends.org/">XAMPP</a>), and then upload the results.</p>
