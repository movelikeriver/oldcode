<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for downloading Seemes CMS (<em>see-mes see-emm-ess</em>), a content management system designed to make the life of a developer easy.</p>
<p>If you're new to Seemes, we recommend reading the <a href="install.htm">installation guide</a>. If you're trying to upgrade your existing Seemes installation, then you'll want to read the <a href="upgrade.htm">upgrading guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> A fundimental knowledge of HTML is <em>required</em> to operate a website powered by Seemes, and a basic grasp of CSS would be helpful. Keep in mind that the more you know of each, the better your website can be, no matter what (if any) content management system you use.</p>
