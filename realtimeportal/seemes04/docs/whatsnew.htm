<h3>Version 0.4</h3>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> 7 April, 2008</p>
<h4>Version description</h4>
<p>Seemes 0.4 is an update to Seemes 0.4 Beta 1, including bug fixes and feature updates, and is also the first 0.4 release marked as "stable."</p>
<h4>New features</h4>
<ul>
<li>A control panel has finally been added for managing files in the image directory.</li>

<li>Increased the maximum upload size in the <strong>File manager</strong> to 100Mb. <em>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you still can't upload large files, check your <code>php.ini</code>'s value for <code>upload_max_filesize</code> and <code>post_max_size</code>.)</em></li>
<li>Minor tweaks to the default theme.</li>
<li>The HTML used for page headers can now be changed via a variable in <code>config.php</code>.</li>
<li>The menu customization now lets you specify extra menu item HTML when that item is for the current page.</li>
<li>The year on the default copyright notice in the installer has been updated from 2007 to 2008.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quotation marks in the website title and copyright are now correctly saved by the installer.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Version 0.4 Beta 1</h3>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> 7 December, 2007</p>
<h4>Version description</h4>
<p>Seemes 0.4 Beta 1 is an update to Seemes 0.3, including bug fixes and feature updates.</p>
<h4>New features</h4>
<ul>
<li>The installer has been rewritten. New features include:
<ul>
<li>Cleaner, 3-step installation process</li>
<li>Permissions check before installation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The menu system has been rewritten to allow customization of menu output, as well as easier adding of other menu features down the road.</li>
<li>The old theme has been replaced.</li>
<li>You can now set themes for individual pages, as well as globally.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect handling of HTML entities when loading the extra content for page editing.</li>
<li>When editing pages, <code>/</code>'s inside HTML comments no longer become <code>&amp;#x2F;</code>'s.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Things that'll break</h4>
<ul>
<li>Because of modifications to the way <code>extra</code> files (the files that store extra page-specific data, such as extra <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> data) have been reworked to allow for page-specific themes, old <code>extra</code> files will be incompatible with Seemes 0.4. Please see <a href="upgrade.htm">upgrade.htm</a> for upgrade instructions. To upgrade old <code>extra</code> files:
<ol>
<li>Download an <code>extra</code> file from your <code>data</code> folder to your computer.</li>
<li>Open it in your favourite text editor. Notepad is probably not a good choice in this instance, because it won't handle line breaks properly if you've been using a *nix-based server.</li>
<li>Your file should have a format something like this:
<pre> onload="javascript:myFunction('foo', 42);"
&lt;script type="text/javascript" /&gt;
function myFunction(myString, myInt) {
	alert(myString + myInt);
}
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
The first line indicates extra content inside the actual <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. Everything after that is extra <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> content.</li>
<li>Insert a blank line between line 1 and line 2, so your file looks like this:
<pre> onload="javascript:myFunction('foo', 42);"

&lt;script type="text/javascript" /&gt;
function myFunction(myString, myInt) {
	alert(myString + myInt);
}
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
The new line allows room to save data about what theme the page should use.</li>
<li>Save the file and upload it.</li>
<li>Now, repeat the process for all <code>extra</code> files.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Version 0.3</h3>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> 7 August, 2007</p>
<h4>Version description</h4>
<p>Seemes 0.3 is a full-version upgrade from Seemes 0.2, including bug fixes and feature updates, and is also the first 0.3 release marked as "stable."</p>
<h4>New features</h4>
<ul>
<li>All the file management features have been moved into a single control panel called "File manager."</li>
<li>Normal menu items can now have bulleted submenu items that appear only when the user is on that page.</li>
<li>Theme files can now be edited from within the Admin Control Panel.</li>
<li>The built-in functions <code>listpages()</code> and <code>listfiles()</code> now take an argument indicating what page or file should be removed from the list (multiple items can be passed as an array).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>&amp;'s are now automatically converted to &amp;amp; when loading the page for editing.</li>
<li>All textareas in the control panels for the main content of things are now 80 columns by 25 rows to reflect the standard console size, rather than the 60 columns by 15 rows of before (which didn't reflect anything). (Note that if you're using a screen resolution that won't fit 80x25, the default theme sets the maximum width for textareas to 100% so this should cause no width problems.)</li>
<li>Blank lines in the menu file no longer cause an error.</li>
<li>The built-in function <code>listfiles()</code> now returns all files in the website upload directory and not just those with extensions.</li>
<li>The default theme now validates fully.</li>
<li>When a file is uploaded, Seemes now CHMODs it 0666.</li>
<li>When a page is created, Seemes now CHMODs it 0666.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> 7 July, 2007</p>
<h4>Version description</h4>
<p>Seemes 0.2 is an update to Seemes 0.2 Beta 2, including bug fixes and feature updates, and is also the first 0.2 release marked as "stable."</p>
<h4>New features</h4>
<ul>
<li>If <code>config.php</code> is not found, Seemes now exits with a nice error instead of just spitting out the PHP error.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quotation marks and appostrophies are now properly handled in the website title and copyright line. Special characters are no longer converted to HTML entities automatically; if an HTML entity is wished for, it must be entered manually.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Version 0.2 Beta 2</h3>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> 7 June, 2007</p>
<h4>Version description</h4>
<p>Seemes 0.2 Beta 2 is an update to Seemes 0.2 Beta 1, including bug fixes and feature updates.</p>
<h4>New features</h4>
<ul>
<li>External links may now be placed in the main menu.</li>
<li>Filename entry is now done using a dropdown box instead of a text input box.</li>
<li>Menu items now have their own ID's.</li>
<li>There is now a page load timer; access the current load time by calling <code>timerreturn()</code>.</li>
<li>You can now specify how a page should be added to the menu when creating the page.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;/textarea&gt;</code>'s no longer terminate the editing space in the Edit page control panel. (This is done by converting all instances of <code>/</code> to the element <code>&amp;#x2F;</code> when the page is loaded for editing; the symbol is automatically reverted to <code>/</code> when the page is saved.)</li>
<li>Slashes are now stripped from page names upon page load.</li>
<li>The name of the temp variable used to store the content of the menu while loading the Edit menu control panel has been changed from <code>$menu</code> to <code>$menucontent</code> to avoid overwriting the formatted menu. (This bug made menu editing difficult while using theme files that placed the menu after the page content in the page's HTML.)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Version 0.2 Beta 1</h3>
<p><strong>Release date:</strong> 25 March, 2007</p>
<h4>Version description</h4>

</ul>
